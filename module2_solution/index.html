                <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                <p>
                    Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.
                    Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematic discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and in use in even the most primitive of cultures. The needs of math arose based on the wants of society. The more complex a society, the more complex the mathematical needs.
                    Primitive tribes needed little more than the ability to count, but also relied on math to calculate the position of the sun and the physics of hunting.

                <h2>Physics</h2>
                <p>
                    Physics is the study of the natural world. It deals with the fundamental particles of which the universe is made, and the interactions between those particles, the objects composed of them (nuclei, atoms, molecules, etc) and energy.
                    Physics is the science of Nature - of matter and energy in space and time. Physicists study a wide range of physical phenomena covering enormous scales: from the subatomic particles to the Universe as a whole.
                    All laws and forces of nature originate from mathematical symmetries of space and time, so modern physics currently focuses on studying these symmetries.

                <h2>Chemistry</h2>
                <p>
                   In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.[3] It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[4]
                   For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (astrophysics),
                   how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
